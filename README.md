gradle-keygen-plugin
====================

This plugin provides Gradle ability to generate SSH keys.

It uses [JSch](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/) Java library,
no installation of extra tools is required.

## Usage
```

plugins {
  id 'org.fidata.keygen' version '1.1.0'
}

keygen {
  keyType = RSA
  keySize = 4096
}

task('generateSSHKey', type: GenerateSSHKey) {
  privateKeyFile = new File(buildDir, 'ssh_key')
  email = 'test@example.com'
}
```

This task, when run, would produce `ssh_key` and `ssh_key.pub` files
in `build` directory.

`keyType` and `keySize` properties can be set per-task via its properties.
Otherwise, project-wide values from `keygen` extension are used.

List of supported `keyType` values is the same as for JSch:
*   `RSA`
*   `DSA`
*   `ECDSA`

Note that generated keys are stored in plain-text.
This could become a security issue and should be used cautiously.

Since keys can't be restored, to prevent key loss task will run
**only if either private or public key file doesn't exist**.
If you want to regenerate key (including when you change desired key
properties) you should clean them manually beforehand.

Other types of keys (non-SSH) could be supported in the future.


### Compatibility

*   Gradle >= 4.4
*   Built and tested with JDK 8
