gradle-keygen-plugin
====================

This plugin provides Gradle ability to generate SSH keys.

Usage:
```
plugins {
  id 'org.fidata.keygen'
}

keygen {
  keyType = RSA
  keySize = 4096
}

task('generateSSHKey', type: GenerateSSHKeyTask) {
  privateKeyFile = new File(buildDir, 'ssh_key')
  email = 'test@example.com'
}
```

This task, when run, would produce `ssh_key` and `ssh_key.pub` files
in `build` directory.

`keyType` and `keySize` properties can be set per-task via its properties.
Otherwise, project-wide values from `keygen` extension are used.





Other types of keys could be supported in the future.
